<!-- [Project Logo/Banner Here] -->

## Empowering Education with AI-Driven Knowledge Retrieval

TeIA is a cutting-edge educational platform designed to revolutionize the way students and educators access and interact with information. By combining the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with a user-friendly interface, TeIA creates a personalized and efficient learning experience. The system is designed to handle large datasets and user volumes through horizontal scaling and load balancing.

### Key Features

**Advanced RAG System**: Leverages state-of-the-art language models (e.g., [Specify models you're using]) and vector databases to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.
Institutional Integration: Seamlessly integrates with school and university systems, allowing for the indexing and retrieval of books, lecture notes, syllabi, and other educational materials.
**Dual Access**: Offers both a web-based interface (http://teiaconhecimento.com.br/ask) and a robust API (http://teiaconhecimento.com.br/ask), enabling diverse use cases and potential integrations.
**Scalable Architecture**: Built with Python, LangChain, and FastAPI to ensure efficient performance and adaptability to growing datasets.

**Deployment**
TeIA is optimized for cloud-based deployment using Render for the API and website, Neon for PostgreSQL database hosting, and Qdrant for the vector database. This configuration provides scalability, reliability, and ease of management.
*Quick Setup*: Streamlined deployment process using Render's platform.
*Managed Services*: Neon and Qdrant handle database maintenance and scaling, reducing operational overhead.
*Cost-Effective*: Pay-as-you-go pricing models allow you to scale resources as needed.
*For Institutions with Specific Requirements*: TeIA can also be deployed on-premises within an institution's existing infrastructure.

**Data Storage**
*PostgreSQL (Neon)*: Stores structured data such as user information, documents, and metadata.
*Qdrant*: Efficiently stores and manages high-dimensional vector embeddings for fast similarity search and retrieval.

### Business Model

TeIA aim to start as a freemium SaaS platform. We offer a basic version with limited features for free, allowing users to experience the power of TeIA. For institutions or individuals seeking enhanced functionality, customization, and priority support, we offer tiered subscription plans. We believe this model represents a significant opportunity for investors due to its rapid user acquisition potential, scalability, and recurring revenue streams.

**Free Tier**:
*Target Audience*: Individual students, small groups, or educators wanting to try out TeIA.
*Features*:
Basic RAG functionality with a limited number of queries per month.
Access to a limited set of public educational resources.
Limited storage capacity.
No API access.
Purpose: To showcase the value of TeIA and attract users to the platform.

**Subscription Tiers** (SaaS):
*Target Audience*: Schools, universities, departments, or research groups.
*Tiered Pricing*: Based on institution size, user count, data storage needs, and desired features.
*Features*:
Unlimited or significantly higher query limits.
Ability to upload and index proprietary institutional content (books, lecture notes, etc.).
Advanced search and filtering capabilities.
Customization options (branding, integration with LMS).
Priority support.
API access for custom integrations.
(Potentially) Advanced analytics and reporting for institutions.
